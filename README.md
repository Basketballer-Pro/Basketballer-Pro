Raptors App

- used to showcase skills for job apps
- will make use of react redux and react router

- generates a list of raptors
- user can search for a player and view his stats 
- stretch goal might be to create a graph that shows how many points the player has been scoring recently
- will make use of balldontlie api @ https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction
- in api, raptors team id is 28
- this app will be similar to basketball reference website https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2020.html but i dont want it to be just a lesser rip off. i want the app to build upon something that website does
